# MIDIKit SwiftUI iOS-Only Examples

The example projects in this folder only apply to iOS and not macOS.

## Troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> If Xcode builds but the app does not run, it may be because Xcode is defaulting to the wrong Scheme. Ensure the example app's Scheme is selected then try again.

> [!TIP]
> When building for a physical iOS device, you must select your Team ID in the app target's code signing.
