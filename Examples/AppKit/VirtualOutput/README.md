# VirtualOutput Example (AppKit)

This example demonstrates creating a virtual MIDI output and sending events through it.

## Key Features

- This example creates a virtual MIDI output port named "TestApp Output"
- Buttons let you send a selection of basic test MIDI events

## Troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> If Xcode builds but the app does not run, it may be because Xcode is defaulting to the wrong Scheme. Ensure the example app's Scheme is selected then try again.
