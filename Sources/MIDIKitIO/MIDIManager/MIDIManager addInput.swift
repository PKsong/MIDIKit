extension MIDIManager {
    /// Adds a new managed virtual input to the ``MIDIManager/managedInputs`` dictionary of the
    /// ``MIDIManager`` and creates the MIDI port in the system.
    ///
    /// The lifecycle of the MIDI port exists for as long as the ``MIDIManager`` instance exists, or
    /// until ``MIDIManager/remove(_:_:)`` is called.
    ///
    /// > A note on `uniqueID`:
    /// >
    /// > It is best practise that the `uniqueID` be stored persistently in a data store of your
    /// > choosing, and supplied when recreating the same port. This allows other applications to
    /// > identify the port and reconnect to it, as the port name is not used to identify a MIDI
    /// > port since MIDI ports are allowed to have the same name, but must have unique IDs.
    /// >
    /// > It is best practise to re-store the `uniqueID` every time this method is called, since
    /// > these IDs are temporal and not registered or permanently reserved in the system. Since ID
    /// > collisions are possible, a new available random ID will be obtained and used if that
    /// > happens, and that updated ID should be stored in-place of the old one in your data store.
    /// >
    /// > Do not generate the ID number yourself - it is always system-generated and then we should
    /// > store and persist it. ``MIDIIdentifierPersistence`` offers mechanisms to simplify this.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - name: Name of the endpoint as seen in the system.

    ///   - uniqueID: System-global unique identifier for the port.
    ///   - receiver: Receive handler to use for incoming MIDI messages.
