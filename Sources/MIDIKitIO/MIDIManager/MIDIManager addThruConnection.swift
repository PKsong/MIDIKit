    /// Creates a new MIDI play-through (thru) connection.
    ///
    /// If the connection is non-persistent, a managed thru connection will be added to
    /// ``MIDIManager/managedThruConnections`` and its lifecycle will be that of the ``MIDIManager``
    /// or until ``MIDIManager/remove(_:_:)`` is called for the connection.
    ///
    /// If the connection is persistent, it is instead stored persistently by the system and
    /// references will not be directly held in the ``MIDIManager``. To access persistent
    /// connections, ``MIDIManager/unmanagedPersistentThruConnections(ownerID:)`` will retrieve a
    /// list of connections from the system, if any match the owner ID passed as argument.
    ///
    /// For every persistent thru connection your app creates, they should be assigned the same
    /// persistent ID (reverse-DNS domain) so they can be managed or removed in future.
    ///
    /// - Note: Max 8 outputs and max 8 inputs are allowed when forming a thru connection.
    ///
    /// - Warning: Be careful when creating persistent thru connections, as they can become stale
    ///   and orphaned if the endpoints used to create them cease to be relevant at any point in time.
    ///
    /// - Warning: Due to a Core MIDI bug, persistent thru connections are not functional on macOS
    ///   11 & 12 and iOS 14 & 15. On these systems, an error will be thrown. There is no known
    ///   solution or workaround.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - outputs: Maximum of 8 ``MIDIOutputEndpoint``.
    ///   - inputs: Maximum of 8 ``MIDIInputEndpoint``.
    ///   - tag: Unique `String` key to refer to the new object that gets added to
    ///     ``MIDIManager/managedThruConnections`` dictionary.
    ///   - lifecycle: If ``MIDIThruConnection/Lifecycle-swift.enum/nonPersistent``, thru connection
    ///     will expire when the app terminates. If ``MIDIThruConnection/Lifecycle-swift.enum/persistent(ownerID:)``,
    ///     the connection persists in the system indefinitely (even after system reboots) until explicitly removed.
    ///   - params: Optionally define custom ``MIDIThruConnection/Parameters-swift.struct``.
    ///
    /// - Throws: ``MIDIIOError``
